@Injectable() deco- why
if and only if this service has a dependency on its constructor 
ex  constructor(logService: LogService) it means angular pls inject this dependency into its construstor

NOTE- when we use @Component() deco then no need to use @Injectable coz it autometically add it internally

internally  interpolation is converted to property binding 

<h2 [textContent]="name"></h2>  then in such cases use interpolation
 1 . works always from compo to html
 2 .<td [colspan]="colSpan"></td>

colSpan = 2;
 then error --- can not bind to colspan since it is not known property of td 

DOM --- is a model objects that represents the structure of document 
it essentially a tree of objects in memory 

HTML = =  markup language that we use to represent  DOM in text

so when browser parse html document it create a objects in memory that we reffer to as a dom 

NOTE--- most of the attribute of html element has a one to one mapping to property of DOM obj but few are exceptions  ex colspan 
so when browser arse html doc and create actual dom obh for this <td > but dom obj doesnot have property colspan thats why we got error 


so always remember whenever we r using property binding means we r binding property of dom obj not attribute of  html element 
but in 90% cases we have one to one binding(html attribute to dom property )
for 10% always use <td [attr.colspan]="anyName">

DOM is the tree model to represent HTML.



Add Bootstrap :----
npm install bootstrap --save      "^3.3.7"  itmeans ma

in styles.css

@import "~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css"

[class.active]="assign"

DOM style properties search on google 

[style.backgroundColor]="x?'blue':'white'"


EVENT BUBBLING

<div (click)="open()">

<button (click)="me($event)">click me </button>    then first  me($event) will be called then   open () this is called event bubbling bottom to top

</div>


then how to stop this event propogation   use $event.stopPropagation()   in me($event) method   so this event will not bubble up or 


EVENT Filtering 

<input (keyup)="onKeyUp($event)">
      [(ngModel)]="varName"

onKeyUp(x){x.keyCode === 13} console.log("enter pressed")  but in angular    we can do like this (keyup.enter)="onKeyUp()"  this is event filtering then remove all arguments no need 


Template Variable

<input #f (keyup)="onKeyUp(f.value)">

Two way Binding 

Pipe----  to format data
 Builtin pipes uppercase lowerCase Decimal Currency Percent date



{{name | uppercase}}  we can supply argu in pipe this {{x | currency:'AUD'}}



orderBy  and filter removed from angular2 onword

Custom Piipe
1 add file  summary.pipe.ts 
import { Pipe, PipeTransform} from '@angular/core'

export class SummaryPipe implements PipeTransform{

@Pipe(
{name:'summary'
})
transform(value: any, args?: any):any{
if(!value)
return null;
any logic
}

}

now resistor this pipe in app.module
in declaration[SummaryPipe]                        in the html file {{name |summary:10}}

NOTE --- we can add n no of parameters of any type
